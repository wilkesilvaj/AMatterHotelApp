# A Matter Hotel App

The "A Matter Hotel" app was developed by myself alongside with 3 other students at Douglas College 
as our group project for our advance mobile development class. 
It implements the following features:
• Firebase Authentication
• Firebase Database
• Fragments
• Notifications
• CustomViews (both extended from and developed from "scratch"
• Animations (sliding and shaking)
• ExpandView
• CardView
• ListView with adapter
• Rating Bar
• Threads & Asynchronous Tasks, but "Async Tasks" were later replaced by Thread due to better 
  results in performance while handling image changing animations.

Development team: 
• João Wilke
• Alina Pak
• Volodymyr Pavlovskyi
• Anusha Das
